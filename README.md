# Binary-Converter
A numeric converter from binary to decimal

# Introduction
Created as a learning project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main goal of this project is to understand binary(base 2 numerical system), and provide an easy way of conversion for the decimal system(base 10).
For making this aplication i had to follow certain limitations:

<ul>
  <li>Arrays may not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the users.</li>
  <li>Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function, for example the natural logarithm. It's up to you to figure out which function to use.</li>
</ul>
  
# Parameters

  <ol>
  <li>User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field</li>
  
  <li>User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered</li>
  <li>User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered</li>
  <li>User can enter a variable number of binary digits</li>  
</ol>
